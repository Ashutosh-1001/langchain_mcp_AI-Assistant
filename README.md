# langchain_mcp_AI-Assistant

This project shows how to build an AI assistant using LangChain, OpenAI, and MCP servers. By adding different servers in the mcp_servers.json file, the assistant can connect to many tools such as  Weather, Playwright, or Airbnb. Once running, you can ask it questions in plain English, and it will automatically choose the right server to get the answer. Itâ€™s a simple way to bring multiple services together into one smart agent.
